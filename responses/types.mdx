# Types of Responses

In HITL.sh, reviewers provide structured responses that guide the next steps in your workflow. Understanding the different response types and when to use them is crucial for effective human-in-the-loop systems.

## Response Overview

A response in HITL.sh is a structured decision that includes:

- **Decision Type**: The primary choice (approved, rejected, etc.)
- **Reasoning**: Explanation for the decision
- **Additional Feedback**: Optional comments and suggestions
- **Confidence Level**: How certain the reviewer is about their decision
- **Metadata**: Response timestamp and reviewer information

<Card title="Response Examples" icon="message-circle">
- Content approval with minor edit suggestions
- Transaction rejection with fraud reasoning
- Quality review with specific improvement notes
- Escalation request with senior reviewer assignment
</Card>

## Primary Response Types

### 1. Approved

**When to Use**: Content meets all requirements and can proceed

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "decision": "approved",
  "reasoning": "Content meets all community guidelines and quality standards",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "feedback": {
    "positive_aspects": [
      "Clear and informative content",
      "Appropriate tone and language",
      "Accurate information"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Content passes moderation checks
- Documents meet compliance requirements
- Transactions are legitimate
- AI-generated content is accurate

**Next Steps**: Content proceeds to the next stage of your workflow

### 2. Rejected

**When to Use**: Content violates policies or fails quality standards

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "decision": "rejected",
  "reasoning": "Content violates community guidelines regarding hate speech",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "feedback": {
    "violations": [
      "Contains discriminatory language",
      "Promotes harmful stereotypes",
      "Violates platform policies"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Remove discriminatory content",
      "Rewrite with inclusive language",
      "Review community guidelines"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Content violates community guidelines
- Documents fail compliance checks
- Transactions appear fraudulent
- AI-generated content is inaccurate

**Next Steps**: Content is blocked or returned for correction

### 3. Needs Changes

**When to Use**: Content has potential but requires modifications before approval

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "decision": "needs_changes",
  "reasoning": "Content has potential but requires revisions for clarity",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "feedback": {
    "required_changes": [
      "Clarify technical terminology",
      "Add examples for better understanding",
      "Fix grammatical errors"
    ],
    "optional_improvements": [
      "Consider adding visual aids",
      "Include related resources"
    ],
    "deadline": "2024-01-20T23:59:59Z"
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Content is mostly correct but needs clarification
- Documents are incomplete or have errors
- AI-generated content needs human refinement
- Quality issues can be easily addressed

**Next Steps**: Content is returned to creator for modifications

### 4. Escalate

**When to Use**: Request requires additional expertise or senior review

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "decision": "escalate",
  "reasoning": "Complex legal compliance issue requiring expert review",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "feedback": {
    "escalation_reason": "Legal compliance complexity",
    "required_expertise": ["legal_review", "compliance_specialist"],
    "urgency": "high",
    "additional_context": "Previous similar cases had legal implications"
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Complex policy violations
- Legal or compliance questions
- High-value or high-risk decisions

**Next Steps**: Request is routed to senior reviewer or specialist

## Response Confidence Levels
