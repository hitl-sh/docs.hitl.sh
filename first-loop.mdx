# Creating Your First Loop

A loop in HITL.sh is a human-in-the-loop workflow that routes requests to human reviewers when AI systems need human oversight. This guide walks you through creating your first loop, adding reviewers, and processing your first request.

## What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you'll create a **Content Moderation Loop** that:
- Receives flagged content from your application
- Automatically invites reviewers with QR codes and invite links
- Routes requests to human reviewers via mobile notifications
- Returns structured human decisions back to your system

<Info>
By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional loop with invite codes, QR codes, and the ability to process real requests.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ✅ A HITL.sh account (sign up at [my.hitl.sh](https://my.hitl.sh))
- ✅ Your API key generated and ready
- ✅ Basic understanding of REST APIs
- ✅ Team members who will act as reviewers (with email addresses)

If you haven't created your API key yet, complete this step first.
</Card>

## Step 1: Create the Loop

### Using the API

Create your loop using the HITL.sh API. When you create a loop, you automatically become a member and receive invitation codes for sharing:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Content Moderation Review",
    "description": "Review user-generated content for community guidelines compliance",
    "icon": "shield-check"
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "name": "Content Moderation Review",
    "description": "Review user-generated content for community guidelines compliance", 
    "icon": "shield-check"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
loop_data = response.json()

print(f"✅ Loop created: {loop_data['data']['loop']['id']}")
print(f"📱 Invite code: {loop_data['data']['invite_code']}")
print(f"🔗 Join URL: {loop_data['data']['join_url']}")
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post('https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops', {
  name: 'Content Moderation Review',
  description: 'Review user-generated content for community guidelines compliance',
  icon: 'shield-check'
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const { loop, invite_code, join_url, qr_code_url } = response.data.data;
console.log('✅ Loop created:', loop.id);
console.log('📱 Invite code:', invite_code);
console.log('🔗 Join URL:', join_url);
console.log('📱 QR code URL:', qr_code_url);
```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": false,
  "msg": "Loop created successfully with QR code",
  "data": {
    "loop": {
      "id": "65f1234567890abcdef12345",
      "name": "Content Moderation Review",
      "description": "Review user-generated content for community guidelines compliance",
      "icon": "shield-check",
      "creator_id": "65f1234567890abcdef12346",
      "member_count": 1,
      "pending_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "invite_code": "ABC123DEF",
    "qr_code_base64": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGg...",
    "qr_code_url": "https://api.hitl.sh/qr/ABC123DEF.png", 
    "join_url": "https://my.hitl.sh/join/ABC123DEF"
  }
}
```

<Info>
Save the `invite_code`, `join_url`, and `qr_code_url` from the response - you'll need these to invite reviewers to your loop.
</Info>

## Step 2: Add Reviewers

Your loop needs human reviewers to process requests. Share the invitation information from Step 1 to add team members:

### Invitation Methods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Share Invite Code" icon="hash">
Give reviewers the **invite code** (e.g., `ABC123DEF`) to enter in the mobile app.
</Card>

<Card title="Share Join URL" icon="link">
Send the **join URL** via email or chat for one-click joining.
</Card>

<Card title="Share QR Code" icon="qr-code">
Display or share the **QR code image** for quick mobile scanning.
</Card>

<Card title="Email Invitation" icon="envelope">
Send invitation emails directly through your dashboard.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Mobile App Setup

Reviewers need the HITL.sh mobile app to receive notifications and respond to requests:

<Steps>
<Step title="Download App">
Reviewers download the HITL.sh mobile app from their app store.
</Step>

<Step title="Join Loop">
Using one of the invitation methods above (code, URL, or QR scan).
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Notifications">
Ensure push notifications are enabled for instant request alerts.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Connection">
Reviewers should see the loop appear in their app and receive a welcome notification.
</Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

## Step 3: Create Your First Request

Now that your loop is set up with reviewers, create your first request to test the workflow:

### Request Structure

Requests in HITL.sh consist of:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Required Fields">
- **processing_type**: `time-sensitive` or `deferred`
- **type**: Content type (`markdown` or `image`)
- **priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`
- **request_text**: The main content to review (1-2000 characters)
- **response_type**: Expected response format
- **response_config**: Configuration for the response type
- **default_response**: Fallback response if timeout occurs
- **platform**: Source platform creating the request
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optional Fields">
- **image_url**: Required when type is `image`
- **context**: Additional JSON data for context
- **timeout_seconds**: Custom timeout (60-86400 seconds)
- **callback_url**: Webhook URL for response notifications
- **platform_version**: Version of the creating platform
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Response Type Options

Configure what decisions reviewers can make:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Single Select" icon="circle-dot">
Choose one option (Approve, Reject, Escalate)
</Card>

<Card title="Multi Select" icon="check-square">
Select multiple issues or categories
</Card>

<Card title="Text" icon="message">
Provide detailed written feedback
</Card>

<Card title="Rating" icon="star">
Rate content on a numeric scale
</Card>

<Card title="Number" icon="hashtag">
Enter specific numeric values
</Card>

<Card title="Boolean" icon="toggle-on">
Simple yes/no or true/false decisions
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 4: Submit Your First Request

Create a test request to verify your loop is working properly. Use the loop ID from Step 1:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/YOUR_LOOP_ID/requests' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "processing_type": "time-sensitive",
    "type": "markdown",
    "priority": "medium",
    "request_text": "Please review this user comment: \"This post is amazing! Thanks for sharing.\"",
    "context": {
      "user_id": "user123", 
      "post_id": "post456",
      "automated_flags": ["potential_spam"]
    },
    "timeout_seconds": 3600,
    "response_type": "single_select",
    "response_config": {
      "options": ["Approve", "Reject", "Needs Changes", "Escalate"]
    },
    "default_response": "Approve",
    "platform": "api",
    "callback_url": "https://your-app.com/webhook/response"
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

url = f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{LOOP_ID}/requests"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "processing_type": "time-sensitive",
    "type": "markdown", 
    "priority": "medium",
    "request_text": "Please review this user comment for compliance.",
    "context": {
        "user_id": "user123",
        "post_id": "post456"
    },
    "timeout_seconds": 3600,
    "response_type": "single_select",
    "response_config": {
        "options": ["Approve", "Reject", "Needs Changes", "Escalate"]
    },
    "default_response": "Approve",
    "platform": "api"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
request_data = response.json()

print(f"✅ Request created: {request_data['data']['request_id']}")
print(f"📱 Broadcasted to: {request_data['data']['broadcasted_to']} reviewers")
print(f"🔔 Notifications sent: {request_data['data']['notifications_sent']}")
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post(
  `https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}/requests`,
  {
    processing_type: 'time-sensitive',
    type: 'markdown',
    priority: 'medium',
    request_text: 'Please review this user comment for compliance.',
    context: {
      user_id: 'user123',
      post_id: 'post456'
    },
    timeout_seconds: 3600,
    response_type: 'single_select',
    response_config: {
      options: ['Approve', 'Reject', 'Needs Changes', 'Escalate']
    },
    default_response: 'Approve',
    platform: 'api'
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);

console.log('✅ Request created:', response.data.data.request_id);
console.log('📱 Broadcasted to:', response.data.data.broadcasted_to, 'reviewers');
```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": false,
  "msg": "Request created and broadcasted successfully",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "65f1234567890abcdef12348",
    "status": "pending",
    "processing_type": "time-sensitive",
    "type": "markdown", 
    "priority": "medium",
    "timeout_at": "2024-03-15T11:30:00Z",
    "broadcasted_to": 4,
    "notifications_sent": 3,
    "polling_url": "/v1/api/requests/65f1234567890abcdef12348"
  }
}
```

<Info>
Your reviewers will immediately receive push notifications on their mobile devices about this new request!
</Info>

## Step 5: Monitor Request Progress

Track your request and wait for reviewer responses:

### Check Request Status

Use the polling URL from the response to check status:

```python
import requests
import time

def wait_for_response(request_id, api_key, max_wait=300):
    """Poll for request completion"""
    url = f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/api/requests/{request_id}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    
    start_time = time.time()
    while time.time() - start_time < max_wait:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        data = response.json()
        
        status = data['data']['status']
        print(f"📊 Request status: {status}")
        
        if status == 'completed':
            response_data = data['data']['response_data'] 
            print(f"✅ Human decision: {response_data}")
            return response_data
        elif status == 'cancelled':
            print("❌ Request was cancelled")
            return None
        elif status == 'timed_out':
            print("⏰ Request timed out, using default response")
            return data['data']['default_response']
            
        time.sleep(10)  # Wait 10 seconds before checking again
    
    print("⏰ Polling timeout reached")
    return None

# Check your request
response = wait_for_response("YOUR_REQUEST_ID", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### Request Lifecycle

<Steps>
<Step title="Created & Broadcasted">
Request is created and push notifications sent to all active reviewers.
</Step>

<Step title="Pending Review">
Waiting for a reviewer to claim and respond to the request.
</Step>

<Step title="Claimed">
A reviewer has opened the request and is working on it.
</Step>

<Step title="Completed">
Reviewer has submitted their response - human decision is ready!
</Step>

<Step title="Webhook Notification">
If configured, your callback URL receives the response data.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Receiving Human Decisions

### Using Webhooks (Recommended)

Set up webhooks for real-time notifications when requests complete:

```python
# Your webhook endpoint
@app.route('/webhook/hitl', methods=['POST'])
def handle_hitl_webhook():
    payload = request.json
    
    if payload.get('event') == 'request.completed':
        request_id = payload['data']['request_id']
        response_data = payload['data']['response_data']
        
        print(f"📥 Received response for {request_id}: {response_data}")
        
        # Process the human decision
        if response_data == 'Approve':
            approve_content(request_id)
        elif response_data == 'Reject':
            reject_content(request_id) 
        elif response_data == 'Escalate':
            escalate_to_manager(request_id)
    
    return {'status': 'received'}, 200
```

### Using Polling

If webhooks aren't available, poll the request status periodically:

```javascript
async function pollForResponse(requestId) {
    const maxAttempts = 30; // 5 minutes with 10s intervals
    
    for (let i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++) {
        try {
            const response = await axios.get(
                `https://api.hitl.sh/v1/api/requests/${requestId}`,
                { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }}
            );
            
            const { status, response_data } = response.data.data;
            
            if (status === 'completed') {
                console.log('✅ Human decision received:', response_data);
                return response_data;
            } else if (status === 'timed_out') {
                console.log('⏰ Request timed out');
                return null;
            }
            
            // Wait 10 seconds before next poll
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
            
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error polling request:', error);
            break;
        }
    }
    
    console.log('⏰ Polling timeout reached');
    return null;
}
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Clear Request Context" icon="message-circle">
Provide sufficient context in `request_text` and `context` fields for informed decisions.
</Card>

<Card title="Appropriate Timeouts" icon="clock">
Set realistic `timeout_seconds` based on request complexity and reviewer availability.
</Card>

<Card title="Meaningful Default Responses" icon="shield">
Choose safe default responses that represent the best fallback decision.
</Card>

<Card title="Response Type Selection" icon="target">
Match response types to your use case - single select for decisions, text for feedback.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Request Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Priority Levels">
- **Critical**: Security issues, policy violations (< 15 min response)
- **High**: Time-sensitive content decisions (< 1 hour)  
- **Medium**: Standard content review (< 4 hours)
- **Low**: Quality improvements, feedback (< 24 hours)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Information">
Include relevant context to help reviewers make informed decisions:
- User information and history
- Automated system flags and confidence scores
- Related content or previous decisions
- Business context and implications
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response Configuration">
Design response options that are:
- **Mutually exclusive** for single select
- **Comprehensive** covering all possible decisions
- **Clear and actionable** with no ambiguity
- **Consistent** with your business logic
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No Notifications Sent">
**Symptoms:** `notifications_sent: 0` in response

**Solutions:**
- Verify reviewers have joined the loop successfully
- Check if reviewers have push notifications enabled
- Ensure reviewers are active (not in do-not-disturb mode)
- Confirm the mobile app is installed and logged in
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Request Not Appearing for Reviewers">
**Symptoms:** Request created but reviewers don't see it

**Solutions:**
- Check if `broadcasted_to` count matches expected reviewers
- Verify reviewers are members of the correct loop
- Ensure loop ID in the request URL is correct
- Check if reviewers are filtering requests by priority
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Polling Not Working">
**Symptoms:** Request status always shows "pending"

**Solutions:**
- Verify the request ID is correct
- Check API key permissions for request access
- Ensure you're polling the correct endpoint
- Wait for reviewers to actually respond to the request
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook Not Triggered">
**Symptoms:** No webhook calls when request completes

**Solutions:**
- Verify `callback_url` is publicly accessible
- Check webhook endpoint returns 200 status
- Ensure webhook URL uses HTTPS
- Test with webhook debugging tools like ngrok
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
