</CardGroup>

## Member Analytics

### Activity Tracking

Monitor member engagement and performance:

```python
def analyze_member_activity(members_data):
    """Analyze member activity patterns"""
    members = members_data["data"]["members"]
    active_members = [m for m in members if m["status"] == "active"]
    pending_members = [m for m in members if m["status"] == "pending"]
    
    analysis = {
        "total_members": len(members),
        "activation_rate": (len(active_members) / len(members)) * 100 if members else 0,
        "pending_followup_needed": len(pending_members),
        "recently_active": []
    }
    
    # Check recent activity (last 24 hours)
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    cutoff_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24)
    
    for member in active_members:
        if member.get("last_active"):
            last_active = datetime.fromisoformat(member["last_active"].replace("Z", "+00:00"))
            if last_active > cutoff_time:
                analysis["recently_active"].append(member["email"])
    
    return analysis
```

### Capacity Planning

Determine if you have enough active reviewers:

```javascript
function assessLoopCapacity(membersData, minRequired = 3) {
    const data = membersData.data;
    const activeCount = data.active_count;
    const pendingCount = data.pending_count;
    
    return {
        currentCapacity: activeCount,
        minimumRequired: minRequired,
        isAdequate: activeCount >= minRequired,
        potentialCapacity: activeCount + pendingCount,
        recommendations: {
            needMoreMembers: activeCount < minRequired,
            followUpPending: pendingCount > 0,
            optimalSize: activeCount >= minRequired && activeCount <= 8
        }
    };
}

// Usage
const capacity = assessLoopCapacity(membersData, 3);
if (!capacity.isAdequate) {
    console.log(`⚠️ Need ${minRequired - capacity.currentCapacity} more active members`);
}
```

## Remove Member

Remove a member from the loop (only available to loop creators):

---
title: "Remove Loop Member"
api: "DELETE https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{id}/members/{userId}"
description: "Remove a member from a loop. Only loop creators can remove members. The creator cannot be removed."
---

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the loop
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the user to remove
</ParamField>

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/65f1234567890abcdef12345/members/65f1234567890abcdef12347 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "error": false,
  "msg": "Member removed from loop successfully",
  "data": {
    "loop_id": "65f1234567890abcdef12345",
    "user_id": "65f1234567890abcdef12347",
    "removed_at": "2024-03-15T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Member Management Use Cases

### Onboarding New Members

Track and follow up on pending invitations:

```python
def follow_up_pending_members(loop_id, days_threshold=3):
    """Find pending members who need follow-up"""
    
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}/members", headers=headers)
    members_data = response.json()["data"]["members"]
    
    pending_members = [m for m in members_data if m["status"] == "pending"]
    
    # In a real implementation, you'd check invitation timestamps
    # For now, we'll assume all pending members need follow-up
    
    followup_actions = []
    for member in pending_members:
        followup_actions.append({
            "email": member["email"],
            "action": "send_reminder",
            "days_pending": "unknown"  # Would calculate from invitation date
        })
    
    return followup_actions

# Usage
followups = follow_up_pending_members("65f1234567890abcdef12345")
for action in followups:
    print(f"Send reminder to {action['email']}")
```

### Member Performance Monitoring

Track member activity and engagement:

```javascript
async function getMemberPerformance(loopId) {
    try {
        // Get members
        const membersResponse = await axios.get(
            `https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}/members`,
            { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` } }
        );
        
        // Get loop requests for performance analysis
        const requestsResponse = await axios.get(
            `https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}/requests`,
            { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` } }
        );
        
        const members = membersResponse.data.data.members;
        const requests = requestsResponse.data.data.requests;
        
        // Analyze performance
        const performance = members.map(member => {
            const memberRequests = requests.filter(r => 
                r.response_by === member.user_id && r.status === 'completed'
            );
            
            return {
                email: member.email,
                status: member.status,
                responses_completed: memberRequests.length,
                avg_response_time: calculateAverageResponseTime(memberRequests),
                last_active: member.last_active
            };
        });
        
        return performance;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting member performance:', error);
        return [];
    }
}

function calculateAverageResponseTime(requests) {
    if (requests.length === 0) return 0;
    
    const totalTime = requests.reduce((sum, request) => {
        return sum + (request.response_time_seconds || 0);
    }, 0);
    
    return Math.round(totalTime / requests.length);
}
```

### Bulk Member Operations

Manage multiple members efficiently:

```python
def audit_loop_membership(loop_ids):
    """Audit membership across multiple loops"""
    
    audit_results = []
    
    for loop_id in loop_ids:
        try:
            # Get loop info
            loop_response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
            loop_data = loop_response.json()["data"]["loop"]
            
            # Get members
            members_response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}/members", headers=headers)
            members_data = members_response.json()["data"]
            
            # Analyze membership health
            health_score = calculate_membership_health(members_data)
            
            audit_results.append({
                "loop_id": loop_id,

            })
            
        except Exception as e:
            audit_results.append({
                "loop_id": loop_id,
                "error": str(e),
                "status": "failed"
            })
    
    return audit_results

def calculate_membership_health(members_data):
    """Calculate membership health score (0-100)"""
    total = members_data["total_count"]
    active = members_data["active_count"]
    
    if total == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Base score on activation rate
    activation_rate = (active / total) * 100
    
    # Adjust for absolute numbers
    if active < 2:
        activation_rate *= 0.5  # Penalize loops with too few active members
    elif active > 8:
        activation_rate = min(activation_rate, 85)  # Cap score for very large loops
    
    return round(activation_rate)

def get_membership_recommendations(members_data):
    """Get actionable recommendations for membership"""
    recommendations = []
    
    if members_data["active_count"] < 2:
        recommendations.append("Add more active members for redundancy")
    
    if members_data["pending_count"] > 0:
        recommendations.append(f"Follow up on {members_data['pending_count']} pending invitations")
    
    if members_data["active_count"] == 0:
        recommendations.append("URGENT: No active members - loop cannot process requests")

    if activation_rate < 50:
        recommendations.append("Low activation rate - review invitation process")
    
    return recommendations
```

## Best Practices

### Member Onboarding

1. **Clear Invitations**: Include context about the loop purpose in invitations
2. **Follow-up Strategy**: Contact pending members after 2-3 days
3. **Backup Reviewers**: Maintain at least 3 active members for redundancy
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor response times and engagement

### Capacity Management

1. **Right-size Teams**: 3-8 active members for most use cases
2. **Monitor Workload**: Ensure requests are distributed evenly
3. **Plan for Growth**: Add members before hitting capacity limits
4. **Regular Audits**: Review membership quarterly
