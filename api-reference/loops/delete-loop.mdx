## Pre-Deletion Considerations

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete a loop, the following data is permanently removed:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Loop Configuration">
- Loop name, description, and icon
- Creation and update timestamps
- Loop creator information
- All loop settings and metadata
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Member Data">
- All member relationships
- Member join dates and status
- Member activity history within the loop
- Invitation records and pending invitations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Request Data">
- All requests created within the loop
- Request content, priority, and configuration
- Request status and lifecycle information
- Broadcast and notification history
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response Data">
- All reviewer responses and decisions
- Response timestamps and metadata
- Feedback and rating information
- Performance analytics and metrics
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data That Survives Deletion

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="User Accounts">
User accounts of loop members remain intact. Only the membership relationship is removed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API Usage Statistics">
Your overall API usage statistics are preserved for billing and analytics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit Logs">
High-level audit logs may be retained for security and compliance purposes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Safety Checks

### Before Deleting a Loop

Implement these safety checks in your code:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def safe_delete_loop(loop_id, require_confirmation=True):
    """Safely delete a loop with pre-flight checks"""
    
    # Get loop information first
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return {"error": True, "msg": "Loop not found or inaccessible"}
    
    loop_data = response.json()["data"]["loop"]
    
    # Check for active members
    active_members = loop_data["member_count"] - loop_data["pending_count"]
    if active_members > 1:  # More than just the creator
        print(f"Warning: Loop has {active_members} active members")
    
    # Check for recent activity (optional: get requests)
    requests_response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}/requests", headers=headers)
    if requests_response.status_code == 200:
        requests_data = requests_response.json()["data"]["requests"]
        recent_requests = [r for r in requests_data if r["status"] in ["pending", "claimed"]]
        
        if recent_requests:
            print(f"Warning: Loop has {len(recent_requests)} active requests")
    
    # Confirmation
    if require_confirmation:
        confirmation = input(f"Delete loop '{loop_data['name']}'? This cannot be undone. (yes/no): ")
        if confirmation.lower() != 'yes':
            return {"error": False, "msg": "Deletion cancelled by user"}
    
    # Proceed with deletion
    delete_response = requests.delete(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
    return delete_response.json()
```

```javascript Node.js
async function safeDeleteLoop(loopId, requireConfirmation = true) {
    try {
        // Get loop information first
        const loopResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}`, {
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }

        const loopData = loopResponse.data.data.loop;
        
        // Check for active members
        const activeMembers = loopData.member_count - loopData.pending_count;
        if (activeMembers > 1) {
            console.warn(`Loop has ${activeMembers} active members`);
        }
        
        // Check for active requests
        try {
            const requestsResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}/requests`, {
                headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
            });

                console.warn(`Loop has ${activeRequests.length} active requests`);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('Could not check requests (may not have access)');
        }
        
        // Confirmation
        if (requireConfirmation) {
            const confirmed = confirm(`Delete loop '${loopData.name}'? This cannot be undone.`);
            if (!confirmed) {
                return { error: false, msg: 'Deletion cancelled by user' };
            }
        }
        
        // Proceed with deletion
        const deleteResponse = await axios.delete(`https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}`, {
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
        });
        
        return deleteResponse.data;

## Bulk Operations

### Delete Multiple Loops

Handle multiple loop deletions with error handling:

```python
def bulk_delete_loops(loop_ids, dry_run=True):
    """Delete multiple loops with safety checks"""
    results = []
    
    for loop_id in loop_ids:
        try:
            if dry_run:
                # Just check if we can access the loop
                response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    loop_data = response.json()["data"]["loop"]
                    results.append({
                        "loop_id": loop_id,
                        "name": loop_data["name"],
                        "members": loop_data["member_count"],
                        "status": "ready_to_delete" if dry_run else "deleted"
                    })
                else:
                    results.append({
                        "loop_id": loop_id,
                        "error": response.json()["msg"],
                        "status": "error"
                    })
            else:
                # Actually delete the loop
                response = requests.delete(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    results.append({
                        "loop_id": loop_id,
                        "status": "deleted",
                        "deleted_at": response.json()["data"]["deleted_at"]
                    })
                else:
                    results.append({
                        "loop_id": loop_id,
                        "error": response.json()["msg"],
                        "status": "error"
                    })
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({
                "loop_id": loop_id,
                "error": str(e),
                "status": "exception"
            })
    
    return results

# Usage
loop_ids = ["65f1234567890abcdef12345", "65f1234567890abcdef12346"]

# Dry run first
print("Dry run results:")
dry_results = bulk_delete_loops(loop_ids, dry_run=True)
for result in dry_results:
    print(f"  {result}")

# Actual deletion (uncomment to execute)
# print("\nActual deletion:")
# actual_results = bulk_delete_loops(loop_ids, dry_run=False)
```

## Access Control

### Who Can Delete Loops

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Loop Creators Only">
Only the user who created the loop can delete it. This is strictly enforced by checking the `creator_id`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API Key Authorization">
API keys can only delete loops created by the same user account that owns the API key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Member Deletion Rights">
Loop members cannot delete loops, even if they are administrators in the mobile app.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Loop Not Found">
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "msg": "Loop not found"
}
```

**Causes:**
- Invalid loop ID
- Loop already deleted
- User doesn't own the loop
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access Denied">
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "msg": "Access denied to this loop"
}
```

**Cause:** Only loop creators can delete loops.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Loop Has Active Requests">
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "msg": "Cannot delete loop with active requests"
}
```

**Cause:** Some implementations may prevent deletion of loops with pending or claimed requests.
**Solution:** Cancel or complete all active requests first.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternatives to Deletion

### Archive Instead of Delete

Consider these alternatives before permanent deletion:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def archive_loop(loop_id):
    """Archive a loop by updating its name instead of deleting"""
    
    # Get current loop data
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}", headers=headers)
    loop_data = response.json()["data"]["loop"]
    
    # Update with archived naming
    archived_name = f"[ARCHIVED] {loop_data['name']}"
    archived_description = f"ARCHIVED on {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} - {loop_data.get('description', '')}"
    
    update_response = requests.put(
        f"https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/{loop_id}",
        headers=headers,
        json={
            "name": archived_name,
            "description": archived_description
        }
    )
    
    return update_response.json()
```

```javascript Node.js
async function archiveLoop(loopId) {
    // Get current loop data
    const response = await axios.get(`https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}`, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
    });
    
    const loopData = response.data.data.loop;
    
    // Update with archived naming
    const archivedName = `[ARCHIVED] ${loopData.name}`;
    const archivedDescription = `ARCHIVED on ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]} - ${loopData.description || ''}`;
    
    const updateResponse = await axios.put(
        `https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops/${loopId}`,
        {
            name: archivedName,
            description: archivedDescription
        },
        {
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        }
    );
    
    return updateResponse.data;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Recovery Options

### No Recovery Available

<Warning>
Once a loop is deleted, there is **no way to recover** the data. The deletion is immediate and permanent.
</Warning>

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Export Data First**: Before deletion, export important data
2. **Use Staging Loops**: Test with non-production loops
3. **Archive Instead**: Consider archiving rather than deleting
4. **Team Review**: Have deletions reviewed by team members
