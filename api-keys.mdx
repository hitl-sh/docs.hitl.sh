# API Keys

API keys are your secure credentials for integrating HITL.sh with your applications, workflows, and third-party tools. They authenticate your requests and ensure only authorized systems can interact with your loops and data.

## Understanding API Keys

API keys in HITL.sh serve as your application's identity and provide secure access to:

- **Loop Management**: Create, update, and delete loops
- **Request Submission**: Send requests for human review
- **Response Retrieval**: Fetch human decisions and feedback
- **Webhook Configuration**: Set up event notifications
- **Analytics Access**: Retrieve performance metrics and reports

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Generating Your First API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Access API Settings">
Navigate to your dashboard and click on "Settings" â†’ "API Keys" in the sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Key">
Click the "Generate New API Key" button to create a new key.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Permissions">
Set the appropriate permissions for your use case:
- **Read**: View loops, requests, and responses
- **Write**: Create and update loops and requests
- **Admin**: Full access including deletion and user management
</Step>

<Step title="Copy and Store">
Copy the generated API key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see the full key again.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
API keys are generated as 64-character hexadecimal strings. Store them securely in environment variables or secure configuration files.
</Info>

## API Key Management

### Viewing Active Keys

Your dashboard shows all active API keys with their:

- **Name**: Descriptive label for easy identification
- **Permissions**: Access level granted to the key
- **Created Date**: When the key was generated
- **Last Used**: Most recent activity timestamp
- **Status**: Active, suspended, or expired

## Using API Keys

### Authentication Header

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Example API Request

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.hitl.sh/v1/loops' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Content Moderation",
    "description": "Review flagged content for inappropriate material"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "id": "loop_abc123",
  "name": "Content Moderation",
  "description": "Review flagged content for inappropriate material",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Integration Examples

### Python Integration

```python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.hitl.sh/v1"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Create a new loop
response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/loops",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "name": "Quality Review",
        "description": "Review AI-generated content quality"
    }
)
```

### Node.js Integration

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const baseURL = 'https://api.hitl.sh/v1';

const client = axios.create({
  baseURL,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

// Submit a request for review
const submitRequest = async (loopId, content) => {
  try {
    const response = await client.post(`/loops/${loopId}/requests`, {
      content,
      priority: 'high'
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting request:', error);
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Invalid API Key">
- Verify the key is copied correctly without extra spaces
- Check if the key has expired or been revoked
- Ensure the key has the required permissions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied">
- Review the key's permission settings
- Check if the requested operation requires higher permissions
- Verify the key is associated with the correct account
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
- Check your current usage against plan limits
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
