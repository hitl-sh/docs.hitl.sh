# Introduction to HITL.sh

HITL.sh is a powerful human-in-the-loop platform that enables you to seamlessly integrate human decision-making into your AI workflows. Whether you're building content moderation systems, approval workflows, or AI training pipelines, HITL.sh provides the infrastructure to ensure human oversight where it matters most.

## What is Human-in-the-Loop?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) is an approach that combines AI automation with human expertise to create more reliable, accurate, and trustworthy systems. Instead of fully automated processes that might make errors, HITL systems route uncertain decisions to human reviewers who can apply judgment, context, and domain knowledge.

- **Learning**: Improve AI models with human feedback and corrections
</Card>

## How HITL.sh Works

HITL.sh operates on a simple but powerful concept:

<Steps>
<Step title="AI makes a decision">
Your AI system processes a request and either makes a decision or identifies uncertainty.
</Step>

<Step title="Route to human review">
When confidence is low or human oversight is required, HITL.sh routes the request to appropriate human reviewers.
</Step>

<Step title="Human decision">
Reviewers examine the request using our intuitive mobile app or web interface and provide their decision.
</Step>

<Step title="Return to workflow">
The human decision is sent back to your system, completing the loop and enabling your workflow to continue.
</Step>
</Steps>
